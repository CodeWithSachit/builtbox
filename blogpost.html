                        <h3>Lamborghini’s success story is a testament to innovation, ambition, and excellence in
                            engineering. Founded in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, the company initially aimed to rival
                            Ferrari by producing luxury sports cars that combined cutting-edge technology with bold,
                            iconic designs. The launch of the Lamborghini Miura in 1966 marked a turning point, as it
                            set new standards in speed, performance, and aesthetics, establishing the brand as a leader
                            in the supercar industry.</h3>
